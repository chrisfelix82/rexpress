rexpress
========

This is an Express based node server with Socket.io support.  It aids in the development of RESTful services and uses requirejs for module loading

Make sure you have nodejs installed, and then from the rexpress directoryrun:

```
npm install
bower install
node app.js
```

You can then navigate to http://localhost:3434/ and you should see "Hello World".

Try navigating to the RESTful service http://localhost:3434/rest/user as well to see the json response.
